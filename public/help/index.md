## How to play
Othello is a simple game that you play on an 8 by 8 in (20 by 20 cm) checkered board with 64 double-sided black and white discs. The game is easy to learn, but it takes time to master and develop your strategies for winning the game.

### Object of the Game
The goal is to get the majority of colour discs on the board at the end of the game.

Then the game alternates between white and black until:

* one player can not make a valid move to outflank the opponent.
* both players have no valid moves.

When a player has no valid moves, he pass his turn and the opponent continues.

A player can not voluntarily forfeit his turn.

When both players can not make a valid move the gane ends.

### Valid Moves
A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in a position that "out-flanks" one or more of the opponent's discs.


A disc or row of discs is outflanked when it is surrounded at the ends by discs of the opposite color.

A disc may outflank any number of discs in one or more rows in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

For example: a white piece is being placed on the board that creates a straight line made up of a white piece at either end and only black pieces in between.

White places in the illustration a disc on E3.

The black discs on E4, E5 and E6 are now outflanked by the white disc on E3 and the white disc on E7.

The black discs will be flipped to white.


All the discs which are outflanked will be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip them.

Discs may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the disc being played.

If you can't outflank and flip at least one opposing disc, you must pass your turn. However, if a move is available to you, you can't forfeit your turn.

Once a disc has been placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game.

When a player runs out of discs, but still has opportunities to outflank an opposing disc, then the opponent must give the player a disc to use.

### End of the Game
When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over.
